# Boiii-patcher
While installing EZZ BOIII, my friends and I ran into an issue that hasn’t been patched by the developers — the common “You need to have an online connection” error. Since we all experienced it, I created a patcher that fixes the problem. Just run the .exe, and it’ll take care of everything.
